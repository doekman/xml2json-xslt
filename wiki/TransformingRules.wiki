1. The root element will be absorbed, for there is only one
`<root>test</root>`
   becomes
`"test"`

2. Element names become object properties: `<root><name>Xml</name><encoding>ASCII</encoding></root>` 
becomes `{"name":"Xml","encoding":"ASCII"}`

3. Numbers are recognized (integers and decimals): `<root><age>12</age><height>1.73</height></root>` 
becomes `{"age":12,"height":1.73}`

4. Booleans are recognized case insensitive: `<root><checked>True</checked><answer>FALSE</answer></root>` 
becomes `{"checked":true,"answer":false}`

5. Strings are escaped: `<root>Quote: &quot; New-line:
</root>` becomes `"Quote: \" New-line:\n"`

6. Empty elements will become null: `<root><nil/><empty></empty></root>`  becomes `{"nil":null,"empty":null}`

7. If all sibling elements have the same name, they become an array: `<root><item>1</item><item>2</
item><item>three</item></root>` becomes `[1,2,"three"]`

8. Mixed mode text-nodes, comments and attributes get absorbed: `<root version="1.0">testing<!--comment--
><element test="true">1</element></root>`   becomes `{element:true}`

9. Namespaces get absorbed, and prefixes will just be part of the property name: `<root xmlns:ding="http://
zanstra.com/ding"><ding:dong>binnen</ding:dong></root>`   becomes `{"ding:dong":"binnen"}`
